Hi! My Name is Elvis Ibarra. 

Driven, Flexible, Adventurous 

My favorite hobby is jiu-jitsu. 
I love it because it pushes me out of my comfort zone and I learn something new every single day. 
I started the sport a little over a year ago and it has completely changed my life. 
I believe that it was a major reason for applying to Lambda School in the first place. 
It's like coding with your mind+body. Good times.
