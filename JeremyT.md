My name is Jeremy Taylor

Three words that describe me are smart, funny and introverted.

My favorite animals are our two cats Angel & Opal and our dog Abbie. If you've never had multiple cats at once, you're missing out on many cool and fun interactions such as cat wrestling. It happens to be their favorite sport!
