Hi, I'm Kyran.

My favorite hobby is probably hanging out with my running group, which is based on the British children's game of "Hares and Hounds." One person (the Hare) gets a 15 minute head start and a bag of flour, leaving a trail of flour marks behind them that the rest of the runners (the Pack, or the Hounds) follow in an attempt to catch the Hare. Different symbols drawn with flour mean different things about where trail might go from there. Confusingly, actually catching the Hare is sometimes frowned upon, as it is a general sign that you were trying a bit too hard for a casual run.
