Hello I am Alex Supriana.
Energetic
Free spirit
ambitious 
I enjoy traveling and learning new information. 
I spent most of 2017 out of the country exploring new cultures.
A little about my travel experience started in Puerto Rico, then Peru, a bit of Europe and a tad of Mexico.
Traveling lets me feel free. I hope to find a job that allows me to travel.
