Hi! My name is Kat Johnson-Fries.

Best words to describe me:
- Passionate
- Curious
- Driven

Somedays, I feel like a SuperMom and other days I am so grateful to have a wonderful child who is so forgiving and resilient. Currently, I'm learning to program so I can have a career that combines both my creative interests with my logical approach. It is difficult to balance spending the necessary time at the computer (learning HTML, CSS, FlexBox, JavaScript, CLI, etc.) and spending quality time with my daughter. Recently, we got bikes so we can ride together while listening to Disney soundtracks and soaking up the last days of summer. I hope she looks back at this time as fondly as I do and learns to balance not only her bike, but also working towards long time and enjoying the moment.
