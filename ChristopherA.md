# A Little About Christopher Aronson

I would discribe myself as:
* Carring
* Patient
* Intelligant

My favorite hobby is to play music. I know how to play the _guitar_, _bass_, and _piano_. I also produce my own electronic music. I played jazz bass for 15 years so I am also very familiar with music theory.
