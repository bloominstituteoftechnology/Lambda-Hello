Hello! My name is Stephanie Patton. 
I am adventurous, shy and always ready to learn something new. 
I enjoy traveling to different places around the world and learning about other cultures. I have been studying Japanese for a few years, and was able to study there for 2 years. My favorite animal is horses because they are such free and majestic creatures.
