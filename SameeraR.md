## Hello! My name is Sameera Roussi

**Me in three words**  
Jovial, optimistic, tree lover

**What else can I tell you**  
I love books.  I love reading.  Some may say it is the same thing, but I think there is a distinction. My absolute favorite genre is science fiction and fantasy.  I've also been know to read a crime drama or two. Letterpress printing is a passion of mine.  It's a difficult hobby to pursue because letterpress machines where build centuries ago.  They are fabricated out of metal and as heavy as a car!

**Extra Credit Challenge**  
Just to amend the commit.
