Hey! I'm Meechael. 

Posh, Boss, Proud

I love Instagram. I'm always finding myself checking out my feed, liking photos, and I definitely make sure to post every single day. I honestly think my mood for the day can really be dictated by the number of likes I get on a daily basis. You can bet if I have a low number on any given day, I am not someone you want to be running in to! It's called sass, m'kay?
