Hello, Im Denis Cedeno, three words that describe me are:
	- Invincible	
	- Famous
	- Super Strength

I'm a superhero, its my full time job but I'm a part time Lambda student. Software engineering has always been one of my passions and I'm tired of fighting crime. Although I wish I could fly maybe I should become a pilot...
