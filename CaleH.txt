Hello there, my name is Cale Haug.

I would describe myself as passionate, curious, and young.

My favorite hobby is watching movies and TV shows.  
Documentaries are my favorite, and I have seen exactly zero of the avengers movies.

I think my favorite animal is the dog, because they make such fantastic companions.
I grew up with dogs & cats, but I am thoroughly convinced that dogs are more useful and therefore better.
I have a Yellow Lab/Chocolate Lab Mix named Duffy.
