My name is Kendra McVay! Three words that describe me are curious, ambitious, and spontaneous.

My favorite hobby is to write and listen to music. My favorite genres of music are prog-metal, death metal, and some black metal. I grew up on classic rock, so by default, I like that and modern rock too.}
