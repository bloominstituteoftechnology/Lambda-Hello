Hello I'm Hung Pham. Three Words that describe me are friendly, conscientious, and patient.
My favorite hobby is walking, whether it is walking around urban areas to explore or taking a hike in the mountain. I love walking because I can meditate or getting in touch with the surroundings. I just love being outside, and I will get restless if I am shut in home the whole day. I love walking in urban areas because I get to look at the area changing (or staying the same), and watching people doing their daily activities. I feel more connected with people after a daily walk throughout my neighborhood. If I want to stay focused and meditated, I would like to go hiking, because it's usually not too rigorous but still effortful. I can hear nature sounds and smell fresh air, and be totally by myself or with a few companions. It's a great way to get know myself and my friends.
