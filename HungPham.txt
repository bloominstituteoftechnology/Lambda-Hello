Hello I'm Hung Pham. Three Words that describe me are logical, fast-paced, and Screamo-lover.
I like going to metal-concert because it releases your mind from your daily concerns. When things get crazy at work or at home, I would go to the gym and work out all my problems by pushing my hardest at powerlifting workouts. But for my emotional carthasis, I prefer going to a metal concert. When I enter the mosh pit, I let lose of my self-control and I let out all of my emotions with the banging of the drums and the screeching voices of the band lead.
