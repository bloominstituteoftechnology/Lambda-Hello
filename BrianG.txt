Hello, 

I am Brian. I am honest, motivated, and persistent.

In my free time, I enjoy doing anything outside. This
includes scuba diving, hiking, boating, etc. I have been diving
at the great barrier reef (worlds largest reef) and 
the reef in Key West (three largest). I have yet to be 
attacked by a shark. here
