Hi my name is Alan I live in Dallas, Texas

I would describe myself is as Tall, Competetive, and Thoughtful.

My hobbies change from time to time, but what my hobbies are as of now is learning, listening to music, and working out.

My favorite animal would be a panda. I'm not sure why, but I've always loved pandas for some reason as a kid.
