Hello Lambda!
My name is Dennis Mwanika.
Three words that describe me are; Humble, Smart and loyal.
I am an out-door person. I like to mountain bike in the summer, snowboard in the winter and travel in the fall.
I have a soft spot for elephants, the gentle giants. Hopefully our childrens children get to see them.
