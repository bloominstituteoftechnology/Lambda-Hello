Hi CS13! I'm Caitlin Giguere. 

Three Words that Describe Me: 
    1. Unobservant
    2. Art-hater
    3. Extrovert

I hate nature, art, and cats. In my free time,
I would never go on hikes, draw, or take my cat for a walk. Instead,
I would cut down trees and egg houses for fun.

Just kidding! ^_^

This is just a test for amending things.
