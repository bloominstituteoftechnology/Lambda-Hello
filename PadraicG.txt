Hi, I'm Padraic. I am quiet, sleepy, and leftist.

My favorite TV show is The Wire. I've watched/re-watched it an embarrassing number of times and I always notice new things. It's cliche to say, but the first watch also fundamentally shifted my views on the structure of American society. It's also really funny and doesn't get enough credit for that when people praise it.
