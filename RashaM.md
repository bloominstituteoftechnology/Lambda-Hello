## Hi! My name is Rasha. 

Three words that describe me would be **shy**, **stubborn**, and **thoughtful**.

I love building things, so in addition to being a techie, I am also an amateur woodworker. My favorite things to build are pieces for my 5 year old niece, like a picnic table-sandbox hybrid, or a double sided art easel.

I am 100% clearly and unequivocally a **cat person**.
