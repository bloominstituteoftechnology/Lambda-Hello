Hello, my name is Joshua Vaughn. Driven, Compassionate, Carismatic. My favorite hobby is DJing(Music Production). What I am most passionte about is 
being a husband to my wife, and a father to my daughter. I found love early in life, I am healthy, I am strong in all ways and I love all human beings.
Not only am I wanting to change my families life for the better, but I have a mission in life to see if I can contribute to making a world where
all people cherish prosperity and compassion above all things. With technology and software engineers being modern day wizards I feel Lambda School is 
a good place to start.
