i, I'm Cam MacDonald.

I would describe myself as persistent, generous, and happy.

Other than coding and computer stuff, I love playing golf although it's not going to happen much while I'm in school, road cycling... still waiting for the snow to go away... and reading, mostly sci-fi.

Oh, and I like to bake and then EAT!!!
