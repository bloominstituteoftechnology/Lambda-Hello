My name if Rand Rochester.

Daredevil, courageous, thrill-seeker

My hobbie is sky diving, cave diving and deep sea diving. Whether the adrenaline rush from jumping out of a plane or a cave or the seeing the unexplored parts of the sea. I love taking chances and living life to the fullest. We're all going eventually so why not explore what your capable of before we meet the universe!
