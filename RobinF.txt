Hi Lambda teachers and classmates, I am Robin Uy Familara. 

I am a cool, humble, respectful, self-motivated and team player person

My favorite hobbies are researching, studying, practicing hands-on labs, taking and passing technical training and certifications online. I value creativity and loves to contribute to innovations and national/global initiaatives. I like playing and watching sports such as basketball, football, chess, bowling and golf. I love to explore, learn and apply emerging technologies in  Cybersecurity, Block-chain, Web and iOS Development, Big Data and Data Science.
I enjoy traveling to nice and cool places. Our family love to visit California most specially Los Angeles and San Francisco. Someday I wish to travel around the world.

For me, it is an honor to be a part of Lambda school where cool leaders and people collaborate together and share broad knowledge, lessons, tools and skills.
