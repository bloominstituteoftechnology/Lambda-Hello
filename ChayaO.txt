Hello, my name is Chaya. 

Three words that describe me: Introverted, Pragmatic, Efficient.

I like to stay up to date on current events around the world. I spent a year living in Germany, and recently moved to Denver, CO after spending most of my life in Chicago, IL. I am a big animal lover and currently have 5 furbabies (3 cats and 2 dogs). I enjoy going hiking and camping on the weekends.
