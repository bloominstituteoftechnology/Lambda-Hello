Hello, my name is Orlando Castillo. 

Three words that describe me are ambiguous, story-driven, and border-line-stupid. 
I like long walks on the beach and the smell of roses after deficating. 

On a serious note, I'm interested in film and analyzing behind the scenes on why
the writer wrote a piece that drove the protoagonist to their demise. Pretty much
a lot of F'd up films like Old Boy (original, not the American version).   
Huge fan of Alex Garland, Hideo Kojima, Neil Druckmann and the likes. 

Started my own consignment shop with a partner that ended after one year,
but it was a learning experience. Helped others start their businesses step-by-step
and getting in touch with good connections to help propel their portfolio. Helped a ton
of non-profit organizations with volenteering and working with Haven Hospice,
Grace's Market Place, Humane Society and The Salvation Army. 

My faovrite was helping a community project with painting beautiful art across the college town I used 
to live in. My part was talking to project directors to allow us to use said building
in a bad part of town. The project cleaned up locations that were onced abandoned by
cleaning up the trash and bringing back the life that once was. It worked like a charm.

I like writing, and I haven't read a book since The Martian. 
I wouldn't have a favorite animal, but I like them enough not to eat them, 
but I don't shove veganism down people's throat either. I also listen to a lot of
podcasts, but that's about it. 

In conclusion, I feel I'm a very boring person with little interest. 
I'm enjoying Lambda a lot and learning life lessons along the way with 
feeling less incompetent because I realize that I'm not the only one drowning under 
the tsunami of information.
