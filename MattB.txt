Hi my name is Matt Basile!
Three Words that describe me: Curious, Loyal, and Hardworking

Favorite Hobby: I'm a super huge fantasy football fan. I've been in the same league for the past 10 years and it's a lot of fun. I'm a NY Jets fan, but they've been so bad for so long it's nice to turn to fantasy as a way to consume good football.

Favorite Animal: I like Dogs, Monkeys, Bears, and Eagles/Falcons. I think they're all cool in their own unique ways.
