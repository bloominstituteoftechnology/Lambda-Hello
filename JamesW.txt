Hi, My name is James Tucker Wray. I would introduce myself by my middle name, Tucker, if we met on the street.
Three words that describe me are off-shore bank accounts. I learned early on in life that the truth is complicated. 
Even in hard situations, its easier to get whatever you want by saing what someone wants to hear. In the early days 
of my public education I loaned out lunchmoney for super high interest. I owned so many bicycles before i could
even peddle them I decided to sell them all on ebay. Im rich now and will never have to work another day of my life. 
I spend my days playing chess and studying stategic takeovers of corporate America. 
If i ruled the world Id like a magic carpet to ride around. That would be cool.
