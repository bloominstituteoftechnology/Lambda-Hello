Hi, my name is Amber.
 1. I've been playing WoW for far too long, but it's like and old friend, i just can't give up on it.  Plus it's always changing so there is always something new to do.
 2. I still collect comic books.  Mostly X-Men and Venom.
 3. I have two cats named after elf races in The Elder Scrolls series of games.  Dunmer and Bosmer ;p
