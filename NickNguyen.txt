   Hi there, my name is Nick Nguyen. Three words describe me: Calm, Fun ,Simple. My hobby changes from time to time. When I was a kid I liked biking, swimming, break-dance and lot of video games. Now, I liked reading a good book and eating good food, also I like to travel to new places.I have never been to the West Coast of USA. Hopefully one day I'll make it there. My favorite kind of animal is dog, especially Husky. My favorite movie of all time is "In Time" by Justin Timberlake and "The Matrix 1". I am a big fan of iOS and Apple in general.
