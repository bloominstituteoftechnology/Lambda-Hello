Hello my name is Max. I'm new to FS15 as you already know, and i'm also new to CSS as well as web developement. Thus far i am enjoying Lambda school.

Three words that describe me are curious, quite and boring.lol

My favorite hobby is banging my head agaist my dest trying to figure out why my code isn't working properly.lol No seriously This is what i end up doing every day. 

My favorite animal is a parrot, (wink) and i am interested in becomeing a software engineer.

Lambda School is cool. Wax on Wax Off.

Thank You for Taking the time to read about me.

Take Care
Mr. Metelus



This is the alternate reality version. 
I will describe someone unlike me. 
They hate coding, hate solving problems and talk to every stranger they see. These things are the exact opposite of how i would thinkand act.

I wish i was more creative with the alternate version.
