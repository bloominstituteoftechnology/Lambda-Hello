#Eric SarragaLugo

Hello all! My name is Eric SarragaLugo.
If I had to pick three words to describe the opposite of myself they would be **self-assured**, **deceitful**, and **cold**.
My favorite hobby is dumpster-diving.
My favorite animal is the cat, specifically the hairless variety.

Alternate reality changed in order to ammend. 
`I reject your reality and substitute my own!`
