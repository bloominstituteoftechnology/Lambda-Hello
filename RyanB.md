### Favorites

One of my favorite hobbies involves being in the kitchen as a self taught chef.  I considered doing it as a career but felt it would be best suited as a hobby without the additional stressors of it being a career, as I have worked in restaurants before and enjoy the pace of working in my own kitchen for fun.  In the past few years, I have gotten into molecular gastronomy, which applies principles of chemistry and food science in the kitchen and have focused on using it to make interesting deserts.  An example of such a desert would be a strawberry made out of sugar glass, which I filled with a strawberry icecream that I created using what was left over after making the sugar glass and cooled it using liquid nitrogen.  This demonstrates a theme of molecular gastronomy which often tries to deconstruct various entrees and deserts and then reconstructs them in interesting or unexpected ways.
