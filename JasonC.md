# Hey, my name is **Jason _Jase_ Cook.**
 
**Three** words I'd use to describe myself are:
1. Quirky
2. Strange
3. Awkward
 
>I like to read about quantum physics, especially lately with all the work being done on **Quantum Gravity**, **Emergence Theory**, and **Simulation Theory**. Just because I read about them though, however does not make me any sort of expert. I just have an interest in the metaphyiscal aspect of it, and it gives balance to meaning in my life, the more I try to grok what it's all about
