# Hi my name is Ian French
## Three words that describe me would be: bodacious, tenacious, and perspicacious
### I have several hobbies that I enjoy on a regular basis. I am a fantastic chef, much to the great pleasure of my family. I am an avid gardener, which I found to be surprisingly common among Engineers. I also enjoy playing piano, as I have completed the royal conservatory program for piano in Canada. I really enjoy camping, as in hike in and carry everything with type of camping, not RV camping.  I am also a half-decent astronomer and often take my daughter out with our telescope to look at the night-sky objects.
