Grace: good at puns.

I am a dare-devil, fire-spittin' BMX-boi! I never go on reddit. I'm really chill with the idea of sharks swimming around me while I surf! I hate television. My least favorite network is Adult Swim! I also HATE reading! I also hate video games and exercise and food. And traveling is the worst?
