## About Me

Hello, my name is Jonathan. I'm the android sent by Cyberlife.

Three words (animals) that would describe me are:

- whale
- sloth
- platypus

In my spare time, I love to watch films and anime. I also enjoy playing games from time to time - MUDs are a particular favourite of mine since I can flex my programming skills while doing so. I've played the piano since I was little, and one of my goals upon landing a job after Lambda School is to buy myself a nice big ol' grand piano to practice on. My favourite animal, in general, would probably be a dog, simply because I grew up with them and they have nothing but love and cuddles to give.

## Alternate Reality

Hello, my name is Nathanoj. I am a human.

Three words (animals) that would describe me are:

- swan
- leopard
- doggo

In my spare time, I like to run marathons and show off my extensive trophy collection. Did I mention my modeling career? I have over six million followers. In fact, I should probably be taking selfies right now. Seeya!
